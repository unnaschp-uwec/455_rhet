                <h3>The Silent Treatment</h3>
                <p>The Silent Treatment is a form of abuse by way of not speaking or offering up any kind
                    of communication. It is typical with narcissists, as it is a way of exacting control, avoiding
                    confrontation, and therefore making the recipient of the abuse feel that their own position is
                    wrong.<br>
                    <p>In this manner silence is meant to frustrate and disorient the target.<br> Ultimately, the Silent Treatment is a tactic of
                        avoiding an actual solution,
                        as grievances are not being voiced.</p>

                    <p>The person enacting the Silent Treatment often feels a higher sense of power over the situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to the ambiguity of silence, the target often experiences anxiousness and a lowered sense of
                        self-esteem due to this
                        unproductive
                        method of conflict resolution. Long-term negative effects are common, especially in children who
                        experienced the silent treatment as punishment.<br><br>(Rittenour 2-3)</p>

                <h3><i>The Sunken Place—</i> an institutional form of silencing</h3>
                <p>The Silent Treatement is not just limited to interpersonal relationships.<br><br>

                    In the U.S., the voices of marginalized people (women, POC, LGBTQ+, etc.,) have long been kept
                    silent
                    by those in power— typically, white, well-off, land-owning men. And unfortunately, this still is
                    largely the case.<br>

                    <p>Women through history have been discouraged from speaking, being assertive, and confident— as
                        these
                        characteristics are considered to be unfeminine and challenge the status quo (Rodriguez 113).<br><br> In other words, it makes the rich white guys uncomfortable.</p>
                    <br>This institutional Silent Treatment is enacted by withholding voting rights, bodily autonomy,
                    ability to own land and hold office, etc..
                    As a result, and by design, needs have gone unmet, and individual liberties have been hindered.
                </p>
                For over 400 years in the United States, there was a system of absolute control over every aspect of a
                person's life with no chance for autonomy.<br>
                <p>The film <i>Get Out</i> illustrates the active silencing perpetuated upon Black Americans by those in
                    positions of power. The "place" where one is made voiceless and unable to move is called "The Sunken
                    Place." <br><br>

                    <br><br>The imagery in this scene takes many artistic liberties to illustrate <b>lack of autonomy. <br></b>Jordan Peele's <i>Get Out</i> takes place in modern day, but it seeks to illustrate how
                    (seemingly) antiquated
                    systems and beliefs have persisted through
                    time, and how silencing of a voice can strip people from their own autonomy.</p>

            
                <h3>Silence as Complicity</h3>
                <p>In the face of adversity, those that refuse to speak out are complicit.<br><br>A demonstrated unwillingness to speak; or a commitment to maintaining willful ignorance can be a way of exacting a positionality of "I don't have to discuss this as it does not exist in <i>my experience</i>, therefore it does not exist at all." This scenario is common today.</p>
                <h3>Silence as Survival</h3>
                <p>Silence can also be used as a survival tool, as it masks emotion. Examples in history may be by
                    Japanese-American women and their not speaking on experiences in internment camps; enslaved
                    African-Americans are other examples. In these cases silence was used as a way of concealing outrage, as punitive systems do not tolerate outrage.
                    <br><br>...an “inherited legacy of submission and simply not showing
                    one’s feelings (Rodriguez 113).”</p><br>
